# Colorwise-WebGL
Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to come check out my code for my game Colorwise. This is the code for the WebGL version of my code. I am also working on the mobile version at the same time. This is a strategy influenced coloring game that I wanted to try implementing. Feel free to look over the code and also check out the demo on ShareMyGame.com. I'll attach the link below.
